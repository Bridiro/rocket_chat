# Client-Server chat in Rust

It's based on the Rocket web framework for Rust.<br>
I want to implement secure rooms with a database to store messages, photos and passwords for rooms.<br>
I have to implement a user system so chats and rooms can be restored on login.<br>
I want to permit anonimity too, so to have the possibility to have rooms that do not save messages in the Db.
